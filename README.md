# Description :
In my HR project, I created a comprehensive HR dashboard management system. This platform allows users to apply for multiple job positions, while recruiters can efficiently manage and review the applications along with the applicants' information. The application provides recruiters with an interface to track and monitor the progress of candidates throughout the recruitment process.

The project utilizes a modern tech stack, including Mongoose, Express.js, React.js, CSS, Material UI, bcrypt, Nodemailer, and Node.js. The combination of these technologies ensures a robust and secure system. User authentication and password encryption are implemented using bcrypt, providing enhanced security for user data.

One of the key features of the project is the integration of Nodemailer, enabling recruiters to send emails to applicants directly from the platform. Recruiters can make informed decisions on whether to move candidates forward in the recruitment process or communicate relevant updates.

The user interface is designed using React.js and CSS, providing an intuitive and responsive experience for both recruiters and applicants. Material UI components enhance the visual aesthetics and user interaction within the application.

Overall, this HR project showcases my ability to develop a complete solution for managing job applications, leveraging modern technologies to streamline the recruitment process and improve communication between recruiters and applicants.
